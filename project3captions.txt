Broken localhost: Broken index. For a long time, the index was functioning. Before I was taking my screenshots, I restarted my application, and the index ceased to work. Having it in static breaks things more. Also included is a picture of what the index looked like when it was functional.

TenantView: Clicking on the tenant button redirects you to the tenant page. Tenants can only add new requests.

TenantAdd: Clicking the add button opens a new form. Date is auto-generated for the tenant, apartment number isn't.

Tenantfilled: Filled out form. Clicking the complete button adds it. Tenants must click the add button again to make a new form if they want multiple requests.

Staffview1: Showing one tenant request in.

Staffview2: Showing three.

Filterapart: Apartment filtering.

Filterarea: Area filtering.

Filterdate: Date filtering. This one works trust me, it just doesn't show in the screenshot because it's all the same date. The databaseseeder I was using is also bizarrely nonfunctional.

Filtercomplete: Filtered by completion.

complete1: Staff can select a request and edit its status.

complete2: Completed request.

manager: Manager's view of the tenants.

Mangeredit: Managers can edit info about the staff. The project description mentioned apartment number, but realistically all of these except for check-in date (and maybe even that) make sense to be editable.

managerpostedit: Joe is now in apartment 6.

manageradd: Manager adding greg.

managerpostadd: Greg is here.

managerdelete: Joe is gone.
